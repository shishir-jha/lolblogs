        <p>TypeScript 4.5 ships with some amazing features out of the box. These include enhanced Awaited type that improves asynchronous programming, supported lib from node_modules for painless upgrades, and performance optimization by using the realpathSync.native function.

Also, in the beta release, TypeScript added ES modules support for Node 12. However, Microsoft believes this feature would need more “bake time.” Consequently, this feature is only available via an --experimental flag in the nightly builds of TypeScript.

In this article, we would look at the new additions to the feature-packed TypeScript 4.5.

Let’s get started in the next section.</p>
          {FeatureList.map((props, idx) => (
            <Feature key={idx} {...props} />
          ))}

      </div>
    </section>
  );
