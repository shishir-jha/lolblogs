# Introduction to LolBlogs!

This is my (b)log of whatever I learn, a way to do learning in public if you will!. Currently, I have not thought of what kind of categories I am going to write about. But few come into mind from the get go.

- Series on learning a new tech. And a final review/summary for checking how far I have come and How much efficient I was learning the new thing.(things like whether I procrastinated a lot, how fast I have become or how much I have grown as a developer to learn new tech fast) and also in how many less words can I explain the big picture of what I have learnt so far.
- Recording and notes for a course or book I am reading so I have everything online for me to review. Maybe others can benefit from this too(if they are reading it!)
- Review and follow up from a tutorial or book or new topic. This section will contain those write ups in which I will draft what I built from the new tech that I learnt or how good a certain tutorial or book was i.e. major takeaways(good or bad)
